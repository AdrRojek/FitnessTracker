## Code Overview

### **HealthKit Integration**
The app uses `HealthKitManager` to request authorization and fetch step data from HealthKit. It calculates distance and calories burned based on the user's step count and profile data.

```swift
class HealthKitManager: ObservableObject {
    let healthStore = HKHealthStore()
    @Published var steps: Int = 0
    
    func requestAuthorization() {
        let stepType = HKQuantityType(.stepCount)
        healthStore.requestAuthorization(toShare: [], read: [stepType]) { success, error in
            if success {
                self.fetchSteps()
            }
        }
    }
    
    func fetchSteps() {
        let stepType = HKQuantityType(.stepCount)
        let now = Date()
        let startOfDay = Calendar.current.startOfDay(for: now)
        let predicate = HKQuery.predicateForSamples(withStart: startOfDay, end: now, options: .strictStartDate)
        
        let query = HKStatisticsQuery(quantityType: stepType, quantitySamplePredicate: predicate, options: .cumulativeSum) { _, statistics, error in
            guard let statistics = statistics, let sum = statistics.sumQuantity() else { return }
            DispatchQueue.main.async {
                self.steps = Int(sum.doubleValue(for: .count()))
            }
        }
        healthStore.execute(query)
    }
}
```

### **Workout Logging**
Users can log treadmill workouts with details like duration, speed, and distance. The app calculates calories burned based on the user's profile.

```swift
struct TreadmillWorkout {
    var date: Date
    var totalDuration: Double
    var walkingSpeed: Double
    var runningDuration: Double
    var runningSpeed: Double
    
    func calculateCaloriesBurned(userProfile: UserProfile) -> Double {
        // Calorie calculation logic
    }
}
```

### **Weight Tracking**
Weight measurements are logged and displayed in a chart. Users can edit or delete entries.

```swift
struct WeightMeasurement {
    var date: Date
    var weight: Double
}
```
